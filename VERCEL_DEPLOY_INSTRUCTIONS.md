# 🚀 Deploy to Vercel - Step by Step Guide

## You're on the Vercel Dashboard - Here's what to do:

### ✅ Option 1: Upload Without GitHub (EASIEST)

1. **On Vercel dashboard, look for one of these options:**
   - "Browse" button
   - "Upload" button  
   - "Drag and Drop" area
   - "Import from..." → "Upload"

2. **Upload the `dist` folder:**
   - Either drag the entire `dist` folder onto the page
   - OR click "Browse" and select the `dist` folder
   - OR use the `website-build.zip` file I just created

3. **Wait a few seconds** - Vercel will deploy automatically!

4. **Get your link!** You'll see a URL like: `https://your-site.vercel.app`

### 🔧 Option 2: If Only GitHub Option Shows

**Skip GitHub - Use Netlify Instead (Easier!):**

1. Go to: **https://netlify.com**
2. Sign up (free)
3. Look for **"Sites"** → **"Add new site"**
4. Click **"Deploy manually"**
5. **Drag the `dist` folder** directly onto the page
6. **DONE!** Your site is live instantly!

Netlify gives you: `https://your-site.netlify.app`

### 📦 Alternative: Use the ZIP File

I've created a ZIP file for you: `website-build.zip`

1. Extract it (or upload directly to Vercel)
2. Upload the contents to Vercel

### 🎯 Quick Summary

- **Vercel:** Look for "Upload" or "Browse" option (not GitHub)
- **OR use Netlify:** https://netlify.com (easier drag-and-drop)
- **OR:** Let me set up GitHub (requires Git installation)
